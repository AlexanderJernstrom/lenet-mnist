# LeNet MNIST

This project is a simple implementation of the LeNet architecture, written in PyTorch, proposed in: LeCun, Y.; Bottou, L.; Bengio, Y. & Haffner, P. (1998). _Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition_. The network is trained on the MNIST handrawn numbers dataset.

## Loss function

The loss function of choice is the Cross Entropy loss function

## Optimizer

The algorithm used for optimization is the Adam optimizer
